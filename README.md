"#survival model" 
1. Data prep creates cas table
2. train.sas fit a Cox proportional hazards model to these data
3. model selection: request model selection via the forward selection technique. Effects that provide the best improvement to the selection criterion, the Schwartz Bayesian  criterion (SBC), are added until no more effects can improve the selection criterion. The DETAILS=ALL option in the SELECTION statement produces all tables that are related to model selection. The PLOTS=ALL option produces graphics to help you interpret the selection process. ODS Graphics must be enabled before you can request plots. (For more information about ODS Graphics, see the section ODS Graphics.)
4. stratified analysis: Suppose the variable C3 represents the gender of the subjects. It is conceivable that males and females belong to different subpopulations and might have different baseline hazard functions. A stratified analysis is conducted by specifying C3 as the stratifying variable in the STRATA statement. The CODE statement requests that a text file named ScoreCode.txt be created. This file contains SAS DATA step code to predict survival probabilities at time points that are specified by the TIMEPOINT= option. By default, PROC PHSELECT uses the estimated quartiles of the KM curve (no covariates) of the training data. The SHOWTIME option produces variables that contain these estimated time points.
